            "\n",
            "Twelve other divers and 14 crew, including the captain of the Hurricane, were rescued after abandoning the ship on Sunday morning. The group had sailed out to Elphinstone reef, a famed diving spot roughly 12km offshore and 30km from the resort town of Marsa Alam.\n",
            "\n",
            "According to the tour operator Scuba Travel and Tornado Marine Fleet, which operated the diving boat, a fire broke out onboard at 8.30am local time during a diving briefing.\n",
            "\n",
            "“It is with great regret that we, as the tour operator, with heavy hearts, must accept that three of our much-valued dive guests who had not participated in the dive briefing, early on the morning of June 11, perished in the tragic incident,” said Pat Adamson, a spokesperson for Scuba Travel, the British company that arranged the trip.\n",
            "\n",
            "Mohamed Bendary, the secretary general of Egypt’s Red Sea governorate, stated that preliminary investigations suggested the blaze began in the boat’s engine room. Egyptian authorities said initial examinations indicated that an electrical short circuit in the engine room sparked the blaze.\n",
            "\n",
            "The Hurricane is a “liveabord” vessel, designed to accommodate tourists for days at a time. When the fire occurred, the group were reportedly at the end of a six-day stay on the boat.\n",
            "\n",
            "“At the time the fire broke out 12 divers were participating in a briefing onboard, while those missing had apparently decided not to dive that morning. The severity of the fire meant that the 12 divers were immediately evacuated by boat to another craft nearby and the 14 crew members, including the captain and two dive guides, having tried to reach the missing guests, also had to abandon ship and were rescued,” said Adamson.\n",
            "\n",
            "“The dive boat Hurricane is currently being towed to a port, yet to be nominated, as the vessel is still smouldering with cooling required before entry,” said Adamson.\n",

            "Text: National Grid has broken a 46-day run in which coal has not been used to generate electricity in Britain in order to meet extra demand for air conditioning as the country swelters in hot weather.\n",
            "\n",
            "The grid’s electricity system operator (ESO) asked Uniper, the owner of Ratcliffe-on-Soar power station in Nottinghamshire, to start producing power from the coal-fired plant, prompting criticism from green campaigners.\n",

            "Temperatures broke 30C for the first time this year over the weekend and meteorologists forecast the chance of Britain experiencing a hot summer was 45% – 2.3 times the typical figure.\n",
            "\n",
            "The hot weather is expected to push up demand for power, as households and businesses switch on air conditioning units. Air conditioning accounts for about a fifth of the total electricity used in buildings around the world.\n",

            "Last week, a fault was found on the 1,400-megawatt North Sea Link interconnector that carries power between Norway and the UK, cutting electricity supplies. The power flowing through the 450-mile subsea cable has been reduced by half while the fault, discovered at an onshore facility in Norway, is repaired.\n",

Ami McCarthy, Greenpeace UK’s political campaigner, said: “It is a sign of failure that the National Grid is turning to one of the most polluting forms of power generation to deal with a summer heatwave that we know has been made worse because of climate change.”\n",
            "\n",
            "She added: “The government must get to work and upgrade our energy grid. In summer, we should be turning to solar power, yet we currently have renewable energy going to waste because our grid cannot transmit the power, and hundreds of renewables projects which are on hold because they can’t get connected.”\n",
